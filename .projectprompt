<abstract>
Using best practices in vscode extension development design and then implement a new extension. The extension is called focused-views and it is meant to give different roles in a repo a way to quickly focus on the files that matter to them. 
<requirements>
1. It should work off of a simple configuration file ".focusedviews" that uses cuelang to define the different views and the files that belong to them. 
2. A view can also specify a specific git branch to focus on. 
3. You will need to define the cuelang schema for the configuration file. 
4. We are making an extension that will add a new primary sidebar item called "Focused Views". 5. In the panel view it will have collapsible sections for each defined view containing only the relevant files. 
6. Some options for each section are: "Number Files", "View Readme File", "Show Full Path", "Show Git Branch", "Collapse On Open"
